# Crop-Yield-Prediction

**Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This project focuses on building a predictive model for crop yield forecasting using machine learning techniques.
The model leverages multiple agricultural and environmental factors such as:
-Soil quality
-Humidity
-Temperature
By analyzing these parameters, the system provides data-driven insights to help farmers make informed decisions about crop planning and resource allocation.

**Features**
-Predicts crop yield based on historical and environmental data.
-Supports multiple crop types and varying soil conditions.
-Implements regression and ensemble learning techniques for improved accuracy.
-Scalable design for integration with IoT-based agricultural systems.
-Easy-to-use interface for training and testing models.

**Tech Stack**
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries/Frameworks:
-Scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
-Pandas & NumPy (data preprocessing)
-Random Forest Classification, XGBoost
-Environment: VS Code
-Dataset: Agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop yield records (can be customized).

**Workflow**
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Clean and normalize agricultural datasets.
Handle missing values and categorical encoding.

2. Feature Engineering
Extract meaningful features (soil pH, rainfall levels, temperature ranges, humidity ranges).
Scale/normalize features for model training.

3. Model Development
Train regression/ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression).
Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

4. Prediction & Visualization
Generate yield predictions for given inputs.
Visualize trends and feature importance.

**Results**
Achieved high accuracy in predicting crop yields across multiple crop types.
Demonstrated the importance of rainfall and soil quality as key predictors.
